# MDX

> **MD** + JS**X** = **MDX**

MDX allows using JSX components within markdown. This means it's possible to import powerful components like charts, interactive playgrounds etc and use them within markdown.

I _love_ markdown as an authoring format, but it's limitations can get real, making it unsuitable for anything beyond vanilla content. MDX breaks this barrier.

> MDX has no runtime, all compilation occurs  
> during the build stage.
